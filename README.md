# Smarty_mob_foxy arm64
All the commands on this repository is for Ubun 20.05(focal fossa) foxy version. As I initialllly used the lastest humble version of ubuntu and turtleot3 has no support for humble version, I had to convert to earlier foxy version of ubuntu.


# Ubtuntu (Deebian)
Debian packages for ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy are currently available for Ubuntu Focal.


## Set locale
Make sure that you have a locale which supports ***UTF-8***. If you are in a minimal environment (such as a docker container), the locale may be something minimal like POSIX. We test with the following settings. However, it should be fine if youâ€™re using a different UTF-8 supported locale.

```
akbarjon@ubuntu:~$ locale
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=
LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
```

```
akbarjon@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
